## Instructions

**Fork** the [`carvalho/stats-ml-practicum`](https://github.com/carvalho/stats-ml-practicum) repository at GitHub, and
**create a new branch with your BU login** to store your changes to the document.
Start by changing the `author`in the YAML header of the document to state **your name**.

Below we run some analyses and ask questions about them. As you run the code and
interpret the results within your group, write your answers to the questions following the analyses, but:

> You should submit your work as a **pull request** to the original repository!


## Introduction

In this project we study **tree canopy cover** as it varies with the
**relative distance** to a tree line boundary in urban forests. The dataset inqa[p-=]
`stats-ml-canopy.RData` has three variables: `location` for the urban forest
where the canopy cover was observed, `distance` for the relative distance &mdash;
zero is inside the forest and one is outside (city) &mdash; and `cover` for the
canopy cover.

```{r}
load("stats-ml-canopy.RData")
(canopy <- as_tibble(canopy))

idx <- order(canopy$distance) # for plots below
ggplot(canopy, aes(distance, cover)) + geom_point(color = "gray")
```

As can be seen, there is a clear pattern here: the canopy cover starts high,
closer to 100% when inside the forest, but as the tree line recedes into the
city, the canopy cover approaches zero.

We are interested in two main tasks:

- **Understanding** this relationship more explicitly;
- **Predicting** the canopy cover at the assumed tree line boundary when
`distance` is 0.5.

To this end, we explore four approaches below.

## Statistics 1: Linear Fit

```{r stats1}
m <- glm(cover ~ distance, data = canopy, family = quasibinomial)
ggplot(canopy, aes(distance, cover)) + geom_point(col = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(distance[idx], fitted(m)[idx]))
predict(m, data.frame(distance = 0.5), se = TRUE, type = "response")
plot(fitted(m),resid(m))
```

Questions and tasks:

- Comment on the fit, plot residuals and comment on them.
- Comment on the prediction; does it seem reasonable?

The linear fit follows the trend of the relationship and it is the commonly used prediction since it is simple and easy to understand. Residuals has a clear patterns, not tend to cluster towards the middle, however, it shows some outliers. So it's not ideal.

## ML 1: LOESS

```{r ml1}
m <- loess(cover ~ distance, data = canopy)
ggplot(canopy, aes(distance, cover)) + geom_point(col = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(distance[idx], fitted(m)[idx]))
predict(m, data.frame(distance = 0.5), se = TRUE)

```

Questions and tasks:

- Check the definition of the `loess` function; how does it differ from the previous approach?
- Comment on the fit; does it seem reasonable?
- Comment on the prediction, including the SE.

Loess combines simplicity of linear regression with flexibility of nonlinear regression by fitting models to localized subsets of data to build up a function which describes the deterministic part of the variation in the data.
The fit and prediction are more accurate which is more reasonable.

## ML 2: Random Forest

```{r ml2,message=FALSE}
library(randomForest)
m <- randomForest(cover ~ distance, data = canopy)
ggplot(canopy, aes(distance, cover)) + geom_point(col = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(distance[idx], predict(m)[idx]))
predict(m, data.frame(distance = 0.5), se = TRUE)
```

Questions and tasks:

- Check what `randomForest` does; what is **keyword** here?
- Comment on the fit; how does it differ from the previous fits?
- Comment on the prediction; how would you obtain a measure of uncertainty?

RandomForest can be used for classification and regression. It can avoid overfitting. Keyword is random here.
Difference is this plot is not that smooth.

## Statistics 2: Cubic Fit

```{r stats2}
m <- glm(cover ~ poly(distance, 3), data = canopy, family = quasibinomial)
ggplot(canopy, aes(distance, cover)) + geom_point(col = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(distance[idx], fitted(m)[idx]))
predict(m, data.frame(distance = 0.5), se = TRUE, type = "response")
plot(fitted(m),resid(m))
```

Questions and tasks:

- Comment on the fit and compare it to the first model; plot and check residuals.
- Comment on the prediction and compare it to previous results.
- How would you know that a cubic fit is good enough?


This fit helps to understand true underlying relationship. The fit looks similar but not linear which indicates it might be better for the real prediction. It's not good enough as the residual is not ideal.

## Discussion

Let's try to connect all lessons learned from your work and the discussions.
Elaborate more on the following questions:

- How would you know that the predictions are *rel iable*?
- How would you test that the cover is exactly 50% at the boundary (`distance` = 0.5)? Which approaches would make the test easier to perform?
- How would you incorporate `location` in your analyses? How would you know that
it is meaningful to use it?

We can get information from the predicted value, also we could check the fit plot to see if they correspond to each other.
